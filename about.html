I'm a recent graduate with a master's degree in data science. I dedicate my time to tinkering, looking at trending GitHub repos, and reading recent arXiv papers on machine learning. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games with my friends, listening to podcasts such as the Lex Fridman podcast, listening to early 2000s rock/indie music, or audiobooks on philosophy. I aspire to contribute to solving real-world problems through the power of machine learning in hopes of benefiting humanity.
