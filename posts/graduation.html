                <p>Finally, I graduated from the New York Institute of Technology with a master's degree in data science. But yet, I don't feel any real sense of accomplishment, and I don't really know why. Maybe I thought getting a job and gaining some experience might help me in feeling accomplished, but I quickly learned that it won't be that easy. I've been scrambling around looking for data science and machine learning engineering roles, but most of the time, the job posting is looking for someone with 5+ years of experience. And I'm thinking to myself, "How could that be?" The field is barely a decade old, and yet companies are trying to find somebody who has been around for half that time. Regardless, I'm still making the effort to improve my skills every day and try to learn something new. Although it does come with a few challenges, what do I learn? What do I know or think I know?

                The obvious answer is, duh, machine learning. But what in particular in machine learning? There are SOOO many things to learn about, and it just keeps growing by the day. How about computer vision? But what exactly in computer vision? Do I learn about object detection, semantic segmentation, or image classification? How about the camera pinhole model, or what about SLAM? Or maybe I should learn about natural language processing, but what exactly in NLP? Transformers, BERT, GPT-*, embeddings, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or how about tabular data? You can't forget about them either, right? All of these things are just a small fraction of what machine learning has to offer. And I'm just scratching the surface. I'm not even talking about the math behind it. I'm not even talking about the software engineering aspect of it. I'm not even talking about the data cleaning, data visualization, or data analysis aspects of it. I'm not even talking about the data collection or data labeling aspects of it. I'm not even talking about the data deployment aspect of it. I'm familiar with most of these things, but realistically, I'm a novice at all of them.

                This all seems overwhelming to me, and I feel like I have to know and master all of these things. What path should I take? There are so many questions and not enough answers. But I'm not going to let that stop me. I'm going to keep learning and improving. I'm going to keep applying for jobs and keep getting rejected. I'm going to keep trying and keep failing. Until one day, I will succeed. You know what they say—a broken clock is right twice a day, right?
