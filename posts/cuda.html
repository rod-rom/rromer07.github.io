            <p>In this blog post I will give a high level overview on CUDA and how to program your first CUDA kernel.
                CUDA programming was brought to my attention from this tweet that I stumbled upon and was interested to learn
                more about it.</p>

            <h2>GPUs vs. CPUs</h2>
            <p>The reason why we want to use GPUs in the first place is because they are optimized for computing many
                operations in parallel. This makes them ideal for tasks like machine learning, image and graphics
                processing, video encoding, etc. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed
                by NVIDIA and it allows developers to utilize the computational power of NVIDIA GPUs for their own
                computing tasks. There are two major advantages the GPU has over CPUs ...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tremendous computational throughput</li>
                <li>High memory bandwidth</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This graph below illustrates how to computational throughput in NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs have increased
                over the last decade, measured in units of billions of floating point operations per second. The green
                lines represent NVIDIA's flagship GPUs while the blue line represent Intel's flagship CPUs at different
                points of time. We can clearly see that the amount of computational throughput the NVIDIA GPUs offer us
                is an entire order of magnitude greater than Intel's corresponding CPUs.</p>

            <p>Before we dive into the code, let's go over some high level concepts of CUDA programming.</p>
            <h3>Kernel</h3>
            <p>To utilize the GPU, parts of the program that can be parallelized must be decomposed into a large number
                of threads that can run concurrently. In CUDA, these threads are defined by special functions called
                <i>kernels</i> The execution of a kernel is called <i>launching a kernel</i>.
            </p>
            <h3>Thread</h3>
            <p>When we launch the kernel, the kernel is executed as a set of <i>threads</i>. Each thread is mapped to a
                single CUDA core on the GPU.
            <ul>
                <li>Kernels are executed as a set of parallel threads</li>
                <li>CUDA is designed to execute 1000s of Threads</li>
                <li>CUDA threads execute in a <strong>SIMD</strong>(single instruction multiple data) fashion
                    <ul>
                        <li>NVIDIA calls this <strong></strong></li>
                        <dd>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Single instruction multiple threads</li>
                            </ul>
                        </dd>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Threads are similar to data-parrelel tasks
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each thread performs the same operations on a subset of data</li>
                        <li>Threads execute independently</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Threads do not execute at the same rate
                    <ul>
                        <li>Different paths taken if if/else statements</li>
                        <li>Different number of iterations in a loop, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Host</h3>
            <p>The host is the CPU. The host is responsible for allocating memory on the GPU, transferring data from the
                host to the GPU, and launching kernels on the GPU.</p>
            <h3>Device</h3>
            <p>The device is the GPU. The device is responsible for executing the kernel code.</p>
            <h3>CUDA</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>C with extensions</li>
                <li>Allows for heterogenous programming</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p>When we run into a part of the program that can be massively parallelized, we will pass the execution of
                that portion of the code to the device. The host and device communicate with each other over the PCI
                Express bus. The PCI Express bus is slow relative to the host and device and presents a huge bottleneck.
            </p>

            <h2>Thread Hierarchy</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="../assets/thread_hierarchy.jpg" alt="thread hierarchy" style="width: 100%;">
                <figcaption>Programmer's perspective versus a hardware perspective of a thread block in GPU</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Threads are mapped to cores on the GPU based on CUDA's thread hierarchy. This is an important concept in
                CUDA's programming model and there are three levels in the hierarchy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thread</li>
                <li>Block</li>
                <li>Grid</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Threads</h3>
            <p>At the lowest level in the hierarchy, we have individual <i>threads</i>. It is the execution of a kernel
                on a single piece of data. Each thread gets mapped to <strong>one CUDA core</strong></p>
            <h3>Blocks</h3>
            <p>Next, we have a structure called a <i>block</i>. Blocks are sets of threads that are grouped together
                into blocks. When the kernel is launched the blocks get mapped onto corresponding sets of CUDA cores.
            </p>
            <h3>Grid</h3>
            <p>At the highest level in the hierarchy we have <i>grids</i>. The entire kernel launch is executed as one
                grid which is mapped onto the entire GPU unit and its memory.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Its also important to mention the dimensions of grids and blocks. They can either be 1D, 2D, or 3D. For
                instance, let's we have a grid with dimensions 3x2. That would mean within this grid there are => 3 x 2
                = 6 blocks in total. Now, let's say that the blocks have a dimension of 4x3. This would mean that there
                are => 4 x 3 = 12 threads per block. In total there would be 72 total threads in the grid (6 Blocks x 12
                Threads/Block).</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Program Flow</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Host Code <ul>
                        <li>Serial</li>
                        <li>Runs on CPU</li>
                        <li>Launches the Kernel</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Device Code <ul>
                        <li>Parallel</li>
                        <li>Runs on GPU</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's take a look at some code and see how the program flow works in a CUDA program.</p>
            <pre>
                    <code class="language-cpp">
                        int main(void) { // Host Code
                            // Do sequential work on the CPU
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>First, we declare the main function like the start of any other program. At this point in time, any
                sequential code is being executed on the CPU until the kernel is launched.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                        int main(void) { // Host Code
                            // Do sequential work on the CPU

                            // Launch Kernel
                            kernel_0&lt;&lt;&lt;grid_sz0,blk_sz0&gt;&gt;&gt;(...); 
                        }
                    </code></pre>
            </code></pre>
            <p>The main function continues to run any serial code until another kernel is launched.
                <strong>Note:</strong> The C program does not wait on the kernel's completion in order to continue. So
                if we need to gather the results from a kernel before continuing, you need to add an explicit barrier in
                the host code to tell the program to wait on the kernel's completion to continue.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                int main(void) { // Host Code
                    // Do sequential work on the CPU

                    // Launch Kernel
                    kernel_0&lt;&lt;&lt;grid_sz0,blk_sz0&gt;&gt;&gt;(...); 

                    // Do more sequential work on the CPU

                    // Launch Kernel
                    kernel_1&lt;&lt;&lt;grid_sz1,blk_sz1&gt;&gt;&gt;(...);

                    return 0;
                }
            </code></pre>
            </code></pre>
            <p>The kernel launch syntax follows the same convention as calling any C function. We start with the kernel
                name and we specify any parameters in the parantheses. The only difference is that we must specify the
                configuration parameters, i.e. the <i>grid size</i> and <i>block size</i> within the triple chevron
                brackets. Before we launch a kernel, we need to configure its launch parameters. The code below
                demonstrates how to configure the parameters. <code>dim3</code> is a CUDA data structure which are
                essentially a set of integer values which define the x, y, and z dimensions of the grid/block,
                respectively. If no values are passed,
                the default is set to <code>(1, 1, 1)</code></p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                // Block and Grid dimensions
                // a.k.a Configuration parameters
                dim3 grid_size(3,2);
                dim3 block_size(4,3);

                // Launch Kernel
                kernelName&lt;&lt;&lt;grid_size,block_size&gt;&gt;&gt;( ... );
            </code></pre>
            <p>Since the CPU and GPU have different memory locations, we need to allocate the device memory in order to
                operate on the data. The CUDA API follows a similar style to allocating device memory as C. The list
                below gives you a summarized look at how memory is allocated in C and CUDA. We also need to copy the
                data over from device to host and vice versa using
                <code>cudaMemcpy(dst, src, numBytes, direction)</code>

            <p>To define a CUDA kernel we need to insert what is called a declaration specifier which alerts the
                compiler that a function should be compiled to run on device. This is indicated using the keyword
                <code>__global__</code> and note that there are two underscores in the beginning and end of the keyword.
                The kernel must also be declared with a void return type. Any results that the kernel computes are
                stored in the device's memory.
                Also, variables that are operated on the kernel need to be passed by reference. The code below
                demonstrates how to define a kernel and passes two pointer argumentes that point to the memory address
                of the variable stored in the device's memory.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
                __global__ void kernelName(int *d_C, int *d_in) {
                    
                    // Perform this operation for every thread
                    d_out[0] = d_in[0];
                }

            <h2>Parallelize for loop</h2>
            <p>CUDA allows us to index into threads using the built-in <code>threadIdx</code> variable. To index into a
                thread based on their corresponding dimension using the folowing:
            <ul>
                <li><code>threadIdx.x</code></li>
                <li><code>threadIdx.y</code></li>
                <li><code>threadIdx.z</code></li>
            </ul>
            <code>threadIdx</code> is only unique within its own thread block. To determine the unique grid index of a
            thread we can use the following:
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
            int idx = threadIdx.x + blockDim.x * blockIdx.x;

            <h2>Memory Model</h2>
            <p>Another fundemental concept in CUDA is the memory model. This corresponds with the thread hierarchy that
                was discussed earlier. We have threads which has its own local memory and has a private scope meaning
                that the data cannot be accessed by any other thread. When a thread finishes it's execution it gets
                deleted. We then have shared memory which corresponds to blocks in the thread hierarchy. The highest
                level are grids which correspond with global memory</p>
            <ul>Threads ↔ Local Memory (and Registers)<li>Scope: Private to its corresponding Thread. Each block has its
                    own region of shared memory</li>
                <li>Lifetime: Thread</li>
                Blocks ↔ Shared Memory<li>Scope: Every Thread in the Block has access</li>
                <li>Lifetime Block</li>
                Grids ↔ Global Memory<li>Scope: Every Thread in all Grids have access</li>

            <p>Any time we allocate memory on the device by using <code>cudaMalloc</code> it is allocated in the global
                memory. Since global memory is stored in <i>off-chip DRAM</i>, it exhibits very slow memory
                characteristics relative to the other memory spaces. The use of global memory can't be avoided so we
                must transfer data between the host and device using this memory space. However, the
                <strong>goal</strong> is to minimize the global memory traffic since it is so slow. The upside to global
                memory is that it's very large. It can be accessed with ...

            </p>
            <p>Each thread has its own private local memory and registers that cannot be accessed by any other thread.
                Any variable that is declared inside of a kernel is stored in a register. If the size of the contents
                stored in this variable become too large to fit into the register space then the contents will spill
                over into the local memory. Registers spilling into local memory is very undesirable because although
                registers are the fastest form of memory in CUDA, local memory is one of the slowest regions.

                <li>It allows for threads within a block to talk to each other</li>

            <p>Constant memory doesn't really have a corresponding level of thread hierarchy space. The idea behind

                using <i>constant memory</i> Constant memory is actually very large since it's actuall located in the
                device's DRAM all threads have access to it <i>but it is read-only memory</i> We want to use this memory
                space for data that is accessed frequently but does not change its contents throughout the kernel's

            <h2>Thread Synchronization</h2>
            <p>Since threads are allowed to run in parallel, we can run into race conditions. A race condition commonly
                occurs when a thread reads from a memory location before the correct data has been stored into that
                memory location or when a thread writes its results to a specific memory location before another thread
                has read data from that location. In order to avoid these kind of situations we can use
                <code>__synchthreads();</code> which acts like a barrier. When a thread is met with a barrier, it will
                hault it's execution and will wait until all threads have reached the barrier.
            </p>

            The Host and Device operate asynchronously unless the host code is explicitly specified to wait on the

            To compile and run the CUDA program, follow these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Save the complete code into a file with the <code>.cu</code> extension, such as
                    <code>matrixMul.cu</code>.</li>
                <li>Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the
                    <code>matrixMul.cu</code> file is located.</li>
                <li>Compile the CUDA program using the <code>nvcc</code> compiler, which is part of the CUDA Toolkit.
                    Run the following command:
                    <pre>nvcc matrixMul.cu -o matrixMul</pre> This command will compile the CUDA code and generate an
                    executable named <code>matrixMul.exe</code>
                </li>
                <li>Run the compiled executable:<pre><code>./matrixMul</code></pre></li>
                Your output should look like this if you followed the same input values as in the example above:
                <pre>
                    $ ./matrixMul
                    2.000000 5.000000 1.000000
                    6.000000 7.000000 1.000000
                    1.000000 8.000000 1.000000
                </pre>
            </ol>
            </p>
